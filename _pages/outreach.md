### Waterfall? What am I looking at??

Along our 16 km of glass fiber, we measure how much it vibrates, or 'wiggles', about every 10 meters. Each horizontal line in the image shows you how much that particular section of glass fiber is wiggling. Red means that there are strong vibrations, blue shows the bits where it's quieter.

Starting from the top, you see how much vibrations are currently felt in DESY's PETRA tunnel. Since that tunnel is a few meters underground, there are not a lot of vibrations from car traffic, wind and such. So it's pretty blue. The same is true for the vibrations in the XFEL tunnel - also pretty 'quiet', and blue.

Going further down in the image, we reach the part of the fiber that is near the surface, and roads, on the DESY/Bahrenfeld campus. The car traffic, trees swaying in the wind, and general urban activity all generate vibrations, so those sections of the glass fiber are wiggling more - and show up red!

The whole picture is moving towards the left: that's time passing by. In a newer version of the live stream, we established a **waterfall diagram**, where time and location axes are swapped. In these plots the time is running from the top to the bottom. 

**These are tiny vibrations!** You would not feel them, our measurement device is really sensitive.

You've probably felt the ground vibrating when a big truck passes nearby? It's the same effect, just much weaker, and coming from lots of trucks and cars and swaying trees and other things happening at the surface at the same time.

### Taylor Swift

With our WAVE glass fiber sensor network, we listen to vibrations underground with a thousand ears. On July 23rd and 24th 2024, Taylor Swift performed at the Volksparkstadion Hamburg, just 2 km from our experiment!

During the two concerts, we offered a livestream of our vibration measurements.
We broadcasted our measurements on the Livestream on 23th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST
and again on 24th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST.
Watch this space, we will update with more results over the next few days.
"Swiftquakes?!" Don't worry, these are not real earthquakes!

These are tiny vibrations! You would not feel them, our measurement device is really sensitive..
You've probably felt the ground shaking a bit when a big truck passes nearby? It's the same effect, just caused by lots of happy people dancing.

We already knew that we should able to pick up vibrations of concerts happening in the Volksparkstadion, since we have already picked concerts e.g. by Metallica in the past. Lots and lots of fans jumping and dancing at the same time will cause the ground to "swing along" a bit.

#### Spectrogram

From the waterfall plot, shown on the left in the Livestream, we calculated a 
[spectrogram <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/results/TaylorSwiftResults1/) of the Taylor Swift concert, with some songs annotated. 

![Screenshot]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2024_taylors_waves_spectrogram_annotated.png)

The brighter yellow colors indicate stronger vibrations. The 'ladder structures' shift up and down with the beats per second of the song -- this is probably a result of the fans jumping to the beat, and with that, they generate specific frequencies.

#### PETRA's heartbeats

On the right in the Livestream we showed for the first time DAS data on a map along the PETRA ring. With this visualisation, we are able to show [PETRA's heartbeat during the Taylor Swift concert in Hamburg live! <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/media/TaylorSwiftHeartbeats/).

The ‘rainbow blobs’ show the strength of the arriving signals along the fiber but filtered for different frequency bands. So the wider a specific colour band is, the stronger are the waves vibrating in that range. They also help understand from what direction the signal is coming and help us observe along what path the waves are traveling.
This is what we measured during the entire concert with a ring of optical fiber around the PETRA III accelerator ring of DESY, sped up 100 times. 

#### *Shake it Off* - along the EuXFEL

We animated the seismic signals also along the full fiber track, including the EuXFEL which goes 3.4 km until Schenefeld.
You see that the [seismic waves from Love Story and Shake it Off <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/media/TaylorSwiftWaveinEuXFEL/) reached all the way through the 3.4km long EuXFEL tunnel! These two songs were chosen for the animation as they produced one of the strongest signals in the DAS system.

### Public hearing EM24 

Can We Hear the Goals from the Euros Underground?
With our WAVE fiber-optic network, we listen to underground vibrations with a thousand ears. On July 5th, 2024, during the quarter-finals between France and Portugal at the Volksparkstadion Hamburg—just 2 km from our experiment—we livestreamed our vibration measurements throughout the match. When goals were scored, the celebrations created vibrations that we could detect! This was an exciting opportunity to test the sensitivity of our setup and see if we could capture these vibrations within the fiber network.

**What happened when a goal was scored?**

Before this football match, we already knew that we should able to pick up vibrations of concerts happening in the Volksparkstadion, since we have already picked up a concert by Metallica in the past. Lots and lots of fans jumping and dancing at the same time will cause the ground to vibrate a bit.

We expected that the fans in the stadion will celebrate and jump around when a goal is scored. Indeed, we were able to pick up the football fans getting excited and jumping around during the penalty shooting. We will upload some images here soon!


## WAVE Field and Science City Day

On Saturday, June 1, 2024, from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM, the WAVE team participated in Science City Day at the DESY campus. Visitors explored the fascinating world of our fiber-optic seismic network, discovering where the fiber was buried and learning how it works. Attendees had the chance to generate their own seismic waves and find out what happens when you jump around on a bouncy castle. It was a day filled with hands-on fun and learning!
